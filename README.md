 Image Ip Grabber! (sidenote, go to replit and import this repo)
____________________


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Image Ip Grabber is a simple yet versatile tool i have created to help people click on IP Grabbers. Image IP Grabber is able to pull the following info:
IP, Asn, ISP, Device, Browser, City, and more! Image Ip Grabber only requires you sending it to the victim, and them clicking open in browser, and you will get all their info.
Pretty much, Image Ip Grabber will be able to social engineer people of all types, making this tool even more powerful! 


Please note that this is not a "One Click" Image logger. A One Click Image Logger is defined by just clicking on a image and your info gets Logged. 
Currently, there is no vulnerabillity that allows for such a thing to happen, so most of those are Fake. I advise running any EXES that claim to 
have such a abillity

ip_se_api_key: Go to ip2location.io, and sign up as well. and on the dashboard copy the first api you see,  and go to line 15 and paste it in the two quotes

webhook: Copy and Paste your discord webhook and put it in the 2 quotes

webhook_name: The name of the webhook.

image_path: Since this is mainly using replit, go ahead and get a image of any type. must use JPG. But anyways,

after getting your image, go to the repl and go to where you see all the files. drag the image you have. Now after doing that, hover over the file, and press on the three dots. 

Then name it something like "image.jpg" or something short. After you do that, go to line 11 and in the two quotes, put the image name in there
